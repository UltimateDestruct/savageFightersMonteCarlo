# Savage Fighters Monte Carlo

This is a project to run Monte Carlo simulations on the 
[Savage Fighters](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/286316/savage-fighters) 
multiplayer game books that were created by Joseph Roche.

Moves will randomly be chosen from each fighter, to simulate a new
player that is not familiar with a fighter's moveset. This is not
a perfect process, but if you run the simulation for 10,000 battles
then a pattern should emerge as to which fighters have an advantage
over others.

Once I have this fully up and running, I'll create a table of matchups
to show which fighters have favorable/unfortunate matchups - and from
there it should be straightforward to generate a tier list.
